    "# Code for Calculating the Frobenius Norm of target unitary from different GRAPE functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use two different functions from the qutip control library (\"optimize_pulse_unitary\" from the pulseoptim object and \"cy_grape_unitary\" from the grape object), in order to implement the GRAPE algorithm. From this we obtain a final Unitary $\\hat U$ which should be close to some given target Unitary $\\hat U^*$. We then calculate the Frobenius norm squared of the difference between these two unitary as a measure of the error fidelity:\n",
